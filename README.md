# Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict heart disease using medical data and machine learning algorithms. By analyzing patient data, the model helps identify the likelihood of heart disease, assisting healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and decision-making.

## Features
- **Machine Learning Models**: Utilizes algorithm KNeighborsClassifier for accurate prediction.
- **Data Analysis**: Analyzes key features such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, age, gender, and other risk factors.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides a simple interface for quick and efficient predictions.

## Future Improvements
- Expanding the dataset to improve model accuracy.
- Integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) for easier use by non-technical users.

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the project or fix bugs.
